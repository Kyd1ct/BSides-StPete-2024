# BSides-StPete-2024
I created two CTF challenges for the BSides conference in St. Petersburg, Florida, both focused on digital forensics.

 1. Cache Me If You Can
    - This challenge highlights the complexity of Windows RAM data and teaches participants how much information can be extracted using memory forensics. By working through this task, players will dive into tools like Volatility to uncover hidden data within volatile memory.

 2. Greg's Cryptic Thumbs-Up
    - A multi-layered steganography challenge where players must find a hidden link within a GIF, which leads to a PDF file containing another concealed message. This exercise pushes participants to think outside the box and explore different techniques for uncovering hidden information within files.
